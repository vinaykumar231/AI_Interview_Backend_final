    "transcriptions": {
        "question_1": "I have extensive experience building REST APIs using FastAPI. I've worked on several projects involving complex API designs, data validation, and integration with other systems. I'm proficient in using various features of FastAPI, including dependency injection, data validation, and asynchronous programming.  I have experience creating robust APIs that adhere to RESTful principles, while ensuring efficient and scalable performance.",
        "question_2": "One common challenge is handling asynchronous operations effectively.  I've overcome this by using asyncio effectively and learning appropriate patterns to manage concurrent tasks, such as using background tasks or queues. Another challenge is efficient data validation; I use Pydantic to validate data and handle potential errors robustly.",
        "question_3": "I had to fix a deadlock issue related to database interactions.  I resolved it by identifying the critical sections and using appropriate locking mechanisms to serialize database access.  It was a challenging bug to track down, but a thorough understanding of concurrency helped me identify the issue's root cause.",
        "question_4": "On a recent project, we needed to integrate a new payment gateway with minimal time. I quickly learned the gateway's API documentation and implemented the necessary integration within the deadline. This involved understanding the API requests and responses and creating secure handling for sensitive data.",
        "question_5": "I'm drawn to FastAPI's speed, ease of use, and ability to rapidly develop efficient APIs. Its features, such as automatic API documentation and data validation, significantly improve productivity and code quality.  I believe it aligns perfectly with the current project requirements."

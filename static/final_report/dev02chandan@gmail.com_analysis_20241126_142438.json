        "question_1": "I have extensive experience in developing and deploying FastAPI applications. I've worked on several projects involving building RESTful APIs using FastAPI, integrating them with databases, and deploying them to cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud. I am very familiar with all the functionalities of FastAPI, from setting up routing and dependency injection to handling asynchronous requests and data validation.",
        "question_2": "I have significant experience integrating various AI models into FastAPI applications.  I've used libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning projects. Typically, I'd create the model separately, then use FastAPI to expose its predictions via an API endpoint. I'm comfortable with handling different input formats for AI models and ensuring seamless integration.",
        "question_3": "In one project, I encountered a complex issue where API response times were unexpectedly high.  I systematically checked various aspects of the application. I used profiling tools, logs, and debuggers to identify the bottleneck. It turned out to be an inefficient database query. After optimizing the query, the response times improved significantly.",
        "question_4": "In a previous project with a tight deadline, I employed an Agile approach. We broke down the project into smaller, manageable tasks. Each task had a clear owner and deadline, which were tracked closely using project management tools like Jira. We held regular stand-up meetings for progress updates and issue resolution, enabling us to meet the deadline successfully.",
        "question_5": "I'm very interested in this role because I'm looking to leverage my skills in FastAPI, AI, and cloud deployment.  This role presents an excellent opportunity to make a significant contribution.  I'm also drawn to the innovation and challenges that come with working on cutting-edge AI-powered applications."

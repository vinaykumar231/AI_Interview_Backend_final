I'm comfortable working with various databases and integrating with other systems.",

After hours of debugging, we found out that a third-party library we were using had a conflict with FastAPI's dependency injection. We fixed it by carefully examining the library's documentation and implementing some workarounds. It was a great learning experience.",
        "question_4": "On a recent project, we needed to integrate a new payment gateway with very short notice.  I spent a day and a night getting up to speed on the gateway's API documentation and I was able to implement the integration within the deadline.",
        "question_5": "I'm really drawn to FastAPI because of its speed and efficiency. It makes it very easy to develop and deploy fast, high-performance APIs."

        "question_1": "I have extensive experience building REST APIs using FastAPI.  I've worked on several projects, from small internal tools to large-scale production systems. I'm comfortable with all aspects of the development lifecycle, from design and implementation to testing and deployment.  I'm proficient in using various features of FastAPI, such as dependency injection, data validation, and asynchronous programming.",
        "question_2": "One common challenge is handling asynchronous operations efficiently.  I've overcome this by using asyncio and other concurrency tools effectively. Another challenge is ensuring data validation at the API level. I typically address this by leveraging Pydantic's data validation capabilities within my FastAPI endpoints.",
        "question_3": "In one project, we encountered a very strange issue where some endpoints would intermittently return 500 errors.  After a thorough investigation, I found it was due to a race condition in a database interaction. We solved the issue by using appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure data consistency.",
        "question_4": "In a previous role, we needed to integrate a new payment gateway into our application quickly. I had no prior experience with this specific gateway, but I was able to quickly grasp the API documentation and integrate it within a tight deadline.  I focused on understanding the core functionality first, then iteratively added more features.",
        "question_5": "I'm interested in FastAPI because of its speed, efficiency, and ease of use.  It is a modern framework that aligns perfectly with my preferred development style.  Its built-in features for data validation and automatic documentation make development much more productive."

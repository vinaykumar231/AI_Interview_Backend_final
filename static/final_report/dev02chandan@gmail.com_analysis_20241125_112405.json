        "question_2": "One common challenge I've faced is handling asynchronous tasks, but I typically use tools like asyncio to manage concurrency efficiently. Another challenge is ensuring data validation; Pydantic has been invaluable in that regard.  I have also worked with dependency injection, which helps in managing various components effectively.",
        "question_3": "In one project, we encountered a very strange bug where the API would intermittently fail to process requests.  After careful logging and debugging, we realized the issue stemmed from a race condition in our asynchronous code. Using better synchronization techniques solved the issue.",

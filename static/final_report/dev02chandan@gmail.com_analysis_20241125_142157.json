    "transcriptions": {
        "question_1": "I have extensive experience building RESTful APIs using FastAPI. I've worked on several projects, from small internal tools to large-scale applications, leveraging FastAPI's features like data validation, automatic API documentation, and asynchronous request handling.  I'm quite familiar with its dependency injection system and have used it to build robust and maintainable applications.",
        "question_2": "One common challenge is managing asynchronous operations efficiently.  Sometimes, coordinating multiple asynchronous tasks can lead to unexpected behavior.  To overcome this, I've employed techniques like proper use of asyncio and careful error handling.  Another challenge involves database interactions, ensuring data consistency and efficient query optimization. I solved this by using appropriate ORM and connection pooling techniques.",
        "question_3": "In one project, we encountered a race condition causing inconsistent data updates in our database.  We traced it to an improper use of a shared resource in our asynchronous API.  The solution involved implementing proper locking mechanisms and leveraging FastAPI's features for handling concurrency to ensure thread safety and prevent data inconsistencies.",
        "question_4": "Recently, we needed to integrate a new payment gateway into an existing application. I had to quickly learn the gateway's API and adapt our existing FastAPI application. I utilized the official documentation, online tutorials, and community forums to get up to speed within a few days.  This required me to rapidly understand the API's structure, authentication methods, and data formats, allowing us to integrate it successfully before the deadline.",
        "question_5": "I'm interested in working with FastAPI because of its speed, ease of use, and excellent performance. Its modern features streamline development, reduce boilerplate code, and foster efficient collaboration.  Plus, the large and active community ensures readily available support and resources."

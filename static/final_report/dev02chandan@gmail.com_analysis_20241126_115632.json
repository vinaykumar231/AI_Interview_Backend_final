        "question_3": "In one project, we encountered a very strange issue where a specific API endpoint would randomly return a 500 error.  We approached it systematically, starting with checking the logs, which didn't show anything obvious. Next, we used a debugger to step through the code, and that helped us identify a race condition that was causing the problem.  We fixed it by adding appropriate locking mechanisms to the code.",
        "question_4": "On one occasion, we had to deliver a critical API update under a tight deadline.  We worked closely as a team, breaking down the tasks and assigning them according to each member's strengths. We prioritized the most critical features and implemented a rigorous testing process to ensure quality. We met the deadline successfully, and the API was deployed without major issues.",
        "question_5": "I really enjoy the speed and ease of development that FastAPI provides. I also find the automatic API documentation very useful, and I appreciate the strong community support."

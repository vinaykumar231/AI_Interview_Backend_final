        "question_1": "I have extensive experience building REST APIs using FastAPI. I've worked on several projects where I leveraged FastAPI's features to create robust and scalable applications. For example, in my last role, I developed a high-performance API that handled thousands of requests per second using FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities.  I'm proficient in using features such as data validation, dependency injection, and OpenAPI documentation. ",
        "question_2": "One common challenge I've faced is managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility across different versions of libraries.  I overcome this by using virtual environments and carefully managing dependencies through requirements files.  Another challenge is debugging asynchronous code which can be quite tricky. I usually use logging and debugging tools to help pinpoint the issues.",
        "question_3": "In one project, we encountered a complex bug that caused intermittent failures in our API.  It turned out to be a race condition due to how we were handling database transactions.  By using a debugging tool to trace the requests and adding appropriate locks, I successfully resolved this issue.",
        "question_4": "In a previous project, I had to learn React quickly to build the front-end for an application.  I used online resources and tutorials and practiced building a few small projects to get up to speed.  This was under a tight deadline, and I was able to successfully deliver on time.",
        "question_5": "I'm interested in FastAPI because it's a modern and efficient framework that allows for rapid development of high-performance APIs.  I am impressed by its ease of use and the features that allow for rapid development and improved developer experience."

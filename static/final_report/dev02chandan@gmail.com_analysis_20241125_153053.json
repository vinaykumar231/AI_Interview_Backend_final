    "transcriptions": {
        "question_1": "I have extensive experience building REST APIs with FastAPI.  I've used it on several projects, both large and small, and am very comfortable with its features and functionalities.  I've worked with everything from simple CRUD operations to more complex systems involving asynchronous tasks and database interactions.",
        "question_2": "One common challenge is handling asynchronous operations effectively.  Sometimes, tasks can become difficult to manage if you are not careful.  To overcome this, I typically leverage FastAPI's built-in features for asynchronous programming, and make use of tools like Celery for managing background tasks. Another challenge was integrating with legacy systems. It requires a careful approach.  To address that, I used appropriate adapter patterns and well-defined interfaces.",
        "question_3": "In one project, we encountered a strange bug where certain requests would randomly fail with a 500 error. After hours of debugging, we discovered a race condition in how our asynchronous endpoints were interacting with the database. We resolved this by using proper locking mechanisms and implementing more robust error handling.",
        "question_4": "On a recent project, we had to integrate a new payment gateway. It was a technology I had not used previously.  The deadline was tight but with some online tutorials and documentation, I managed to integrate it in under two days, ensuring all testing was complete.",
        "question_5": "I'm interested in FastAPI because of its speed, ease of use, and modern features.  It's a very developer-friendly framework, allowing rapid prototyping and development, which fits my preferred workflow."

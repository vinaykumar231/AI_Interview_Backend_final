        "question_2": "One common challenge is handling asynchronous operations efficiently. Sometimes, managing concurrent requests can lead to unexpected behavior. I've tackled this using background tasks, such as Celery or RQ, to handle long-running processes and prevent blocking the main thread.",
        "question_3": "In one project, we encountered a strange intermittent error where responses were being delayed or completely failing. After a thorough investigation, I found a race condition in how the database connections were being managed.  By using connection pooling and locking mechanisms, I solved the issue and ensured stable responses.",
        "question_4": "I once needed to integrate a new payment gateway into a project with a very tight deadline. I had never worked with this gateway before. I quickly learned their API documentation and implemented the integration, meeting the deadline without compromising the quality of the code.",
        "question_5": "I'm interested in FastAPI because it combines high performance with developer-friendliness. I appreciate its Pythonic approach and the ease of testing. The modern, sleek architecture makes it an efficient choice for building scalable API solutions."

        "question_5": "Why are you interested in working with FastAPI specifically?"
    },
    "transcriptions": {
        "question_1": "In my previous role, I extensively used FastAPI to develop several REST APIs.  One project involved creating an API for managing user accounts, including authentication and authorization. I leveraged FastAPI's features like data validation and automatic API documentation to streamline the development process and ensure API reliability.  Another project focused on building a real-time data streaming API using WebSockets. This presented unique challenges that I successfully addressed through careful design and efficient code implementation.",
        "question_2": "One common challenge I've encountered is handling asynchronous operations, especially when dealing with external services or databases.  To mitigate this, I often utilize asynchronous programming techniques with libraries like `asyncio` to avoid blocking and ensure responsiveness.  Another challenge is efficient error handling and logging, which I address with detailed exception handling and robust logging mechanisms, integrating tools like Sentry for monitoring and alerting.",
        "question_3": "In one project, we encountered a perplexing bug where under heavy load, the API would intermittently return incorrect data. After thorough investigation, we found the issue stemmed from a race condition within our database interaction code.  By implementing appropriate locking mechanisms and rigorous testing, we effectively resolved the problem. The debugging process involved extensive logging, performance monitoring, and methodical code review.",
        "question_4": "During a recent project, we needed to integrate a new payment gateway with a tight deadline.  I had no prior experience with this specific gateway, but I quickly learned its API documentation, implemented the necessary integration using FastAPI, and completed the integration within the timeline. This required dedicated time for learning the API, utilizing online resources and testing until I was confident in the integration's reliability.",
        "question_5": "I'm interested in FastAPI because of its ease of use, efficiency, and powerful features.  It allows for rapid development and deployment of high-performance APIs, and its automatic documentation significantly reduces maintenance overhead.  FastAPI's community is supportive and active, providing ample resources and guidance, which further enhances the development experience."
